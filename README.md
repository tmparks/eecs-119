# EECS-119: Introduction to Programming, Spring 1984

EECS-119 was the introductory programming course for students intending to major
in Electrical Engnieering and Computer Science. When pronounced aloud, the
abbreviation EECS aptly rhymes with "geeks".

All python and rust code was crafted using traditional methods.

All C++ code was generated entirely by artificial intelligence. Sometimes the
code generated in response to the prompt did not yield correct results. When
this happened, the AI assistant was asked to perform a code review, and all of
the suggested changes were accepted. If the results were still wrong, another
code review was performed. This was repeated until the code produced correct
results.
