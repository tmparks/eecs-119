With the ".JST" command, insert blanks between words in a line so that the last
character of each line (except the last line of each paragraph)
is a non-blank character. The blanks should be added in an intelligent
way: if you select any two consecutive words of the output line,
the number of blanks between them should not differ by more than one
from the number of blanks between any other two consecutive words
in the same line. Adding all the needed blanks between the last two
words in the line is not a satisfactory solution.
